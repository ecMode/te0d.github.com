================

As the technology chair in a fraternity, I saw an opportunity to streamline communication between members through a web application. At the time, mailing lists were being were the main form of communication in use. While the mailing lists serve their function to distribute information, they lacked an efficient way to specify recipients and were difficult maintain any type of organization. The development of CoLab is inspired by this need to a more efficent way to communicate and organize users of a multi-faceted organization.
